Welcome to the refreshed by.KG! After years of serving my photography portfolio faithfully, I decided it was time to bring this site into 2026 with a complete UI overhaul.

## What Changed?

The previous design served me well since the early 2010s, but web design has evolved significantly. Here's what I updated:

### Modern Design System

I replaced the outdated Bootstrap 2.0.1 framework with a custom CSS design system built on modern standards:

- **CSS Custom Properties** for consistent theming and easy customization
- **CSS Grid and Flexbox** for responsive, flexible layouts
- **Fluid Typography** using `clamp()` for smooth text scaling across devices
- **Contemporary Dark Theme** with improved color contrast and accessibility

### Improved Performance

The new design is leaner and faster:

- Removed heavy Bootstrap dependencies
- Implemented lazy loading for images
- Modern CSS instead of framework bloat
- Clean, semantic HTML5 structure

### Better Mobile Experience

With a mobile-first approach, the site now works beautifully on any device:

- Responsive navigation with mobile menu
- Touch-friendly interface elements
- Optimized image galleries for small screens
- Smooth animations and transitions

## A New Writing Section

This is the first post in my new writing section! While photography will always be my primary focus, I wanted a place to share thoughts on:

- Photography techniques and stories behind the shots
- Technology and web development
- Travel experiences and adventures
- Creative process and workflow

## Looking Forward

This modernization keeps the essence of by.KG while making it more contemporary and functional. The clean dark theme puts the focus where it belongs - on the photography - while providing a better experience across all devices.

I'm excited to share more content here, both visual and written. Stay tuned for more photography collections and blog posts about what I'm working on and learning.
