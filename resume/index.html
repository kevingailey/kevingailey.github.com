<p class="bio">Hello &amp; Good Day,<br /><br />  &emsp; &emsp; My name is Kevin, but my friends call my KG. Thank you for taking a look at my resume. A brief background of myself: Texan born and raised. I attended film school across the country in NYC before I finally settled in Denver CO. I have taught myself web design and system administration and continue my learning at every turn. I am an avid reader and tinkerer, lately hacking together IoT devices and administering my own home server. As a digital native, growing up in a time of massive change, I'm accustomed to troubleshooting, investigating and solving issues with technology in an empathetic way. 
<br /> &nbsp; <br /> &emsp; &emsp; I have put these 21st Century super powers to good work, <a href="https://www.newyorkcares.org">volunteering with NYCares</a> to help members of the community get comfortable interacting with computers. I currently use my powers for help in supporting and product quality testing of a top InsureTech SaaS.<br /></p>
